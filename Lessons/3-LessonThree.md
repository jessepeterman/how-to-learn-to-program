# Lesson 3: Learn How To Program
## 1. Choose a small project

Now that you understand the core features of the langauge you chose, spend some time thinking about an app you think would be fun to make on your own. It could be anything really. Here's a list of some common example apps you could write: 

- Todo App
- Calculator
- Text based console game
- Basic Webpage
- Weather App
- Simple website game

## 2. Build that project

Pick one you think is a challenge but not super complicated like, "I'm going to design Facebook on my own", and then plan out how you want to program the app. 

The easiest way to get started is to think of the simplest, smallest task and figure out how to program it in your language of choice. For example, if I wanted to program a tetris clone in Javascript, I would google, "draw a square on the screen in javascript". And then let's say I want to move that square a few pixels everytime I press the left or right arrows then I would google, "get keyboard input in javascript", or something like that. 

Google for whatever you get stuck on. Google your error messages and read some StackOverFlow responses. Try some code. Fix your code. Try to figure out as much as you can from the language tutorial page itself, but if you get stuck: ***Google it!***

Now go and make something!

If you've done all this go on to Lesson 4 -> [NEXT LESSON](4-LessonFour.md)
