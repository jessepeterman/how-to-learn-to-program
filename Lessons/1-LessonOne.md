# Determine if you like programming

One of the most important steps before taking up the task of learning how to program is to decide if it's even worth your time to start. 

There's a few helpful ways to figure this out. One is to read through the list below. Do most of these things interest you? Do they sound like they fit your personality and skillset? 

1. Computers
2. Logic
3. Problem Solving
4. Creating things
5. Learning a lot of new things
6. Learning new languages
7. Getting stuck on something and wracking your brain until you figure it out. 

If you learn programming you'll be doing a lot of this kind of stuff. 

## Get your feet wet with tutorials/videos

If this list of things sounds like something up your alley then I'd recommend trying out a small tutorial that walks through the basics of programming. Freecodecamp.org has a bunch of great stuff. You could also try something on CodeAcademy.

If you're looking for something a little more substantial you could try a course on Udemy. I just look for courses with LOTS of reviews and read through them to see if I think it would be a good fit for me. One that is a great intro to everything Web Dev/Front-End/Full-Stack is The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. He really breaks it down and also makes it fun in the process. The content is a little dated but the bulk of what you'll be doing transfers to modern approaches.
