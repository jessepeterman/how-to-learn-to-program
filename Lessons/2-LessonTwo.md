# Lesson 2: Learn How To Program
## Choose a language

1. Python - great for scripting, simple language, fullstack
2. Javascript - great for web pages, the standard for fullstack, desktop apps, and mobile apps. Great intro to programming because it's so widely available. 
3. Kotlin - Learn this if you want to make Android mobile device apps and games. 
4. Swift - Learn this if you want to make iOS or Mac apps and games.

## Start learning the core language features

For this I'd just start getting the language setup on your system. Learn how to open a basic file and run it in your language of choice. Then set aside 15-30 minutes a day 3-5 days a week (or more depending on how fast you want to learn) and start walking through the tutorial. 

### Tips for going through the tuturial

1. Type in every example to make it run. 
2. After you make the example run, change some of the code and try to run it. Move lines around, Change the variables. Add random things to see what breaks and take note of the error messages. And then **this is very important** make it run again after you break it. 
3. Take note of the features you're learning and begin to brainstorm app ideas you could write with your new found programming skills.

- [Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) - This is the de facto standard for Python reference/tutorial from the source.

- [The Modern Javascript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) - For Javascript I was recommended this website by a Google Engineer and it is pretty awesome. If you want to learn Javascript I highly recommend it.
